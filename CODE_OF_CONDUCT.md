## Goal

My goal is to provide a space where it is safe for everyone to contribute to, and get support for, open-source software in a respectful and cooperative manner.

I value all contributions and want to make this organization and its surrounding community a place for everyone.

As a member, contributor, and everyone else who may participate in the development, I strive to keep the entire experience civil.

## Standards

My community standards exist to ensure that everyone feels comfortable contributing to the project(s) together.

My standards are:

- Do not harass, attack, or in any other way discriminate against anyone, including for their protected traits, including, but not limited to, sex, religion, race, appearance, gender, identity, nationality, sexuality, etc.
- Do not go off-topic, do not post spam.
- Treat everyone with respect.

Examples of breaking each rule respectively include:

- Harassment, bullying or inappropriate jokes about another person.
- Posting distasteful imagery, trolling, or posting things unrelated to the topic at hand.
- Treating someone as worse because of their lack of understanding of an issue.

## Enforcement

Enforcement of this CoC is done by me.

I, as the individual responsible, will strive my best to keep this community civil and following the standards outlined above.

### Reporting incidents

If you believe an incident of breaking our standards has occurred, but nobody has taken appropriate action, you can privately contact me via multiple ways:

**_E-Mail_**

- `contact@antoniosarro.dev`

**_Discord_**

- `@ohhbigg`

I guarantee your privacy and will not share those reports with anyone.

## Enforcement Strategy

Depending on the severity of the infraction, any action from the list below may be applied. Please keep in mind cases are reviewed on a per-case basis and I am the ultimate deciding factor in the type of punishment.

If the matter would benefit from an outside opinion, I might reach for more opinions from people unrelated to the organization, however, the final decision regarding the action to be taken is still up to me.

For example, if the matter at hand regards a representative of a marginalized group or minority, I might ask for a first-hand opinion from another representative of such a group.

### Correction/Edit

If your message is found to be misleading or poorly worded, I might edit your message.

### Warning/Deletion

If your message is found inappropriate, I might give you a public or private warning, and/or delete your message.

### Mute

If your message is disruptive, or you have been repeatedly violating the standards, I might mute (or temporarily ban) you.

### Ban

If your message is hateful, very disruptive, or other, less serious infractions are repeated ignoring previous punishments, I might ban you permanently.
